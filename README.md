## Intro
My name is *Ala'a Darweesh*. I have an MSc in *transportation engineering* from **JU**, I worked as a site engineer for about 5 years. I am, also, so interested to go on at this course.
## Mindset
**Good Developer Mindset**
         
In order to be a good software developer, I *think* he/she should be able to be consistent with simplicity and away from complexity. This may be accomplished by thinking deeply before doing or performing taks. Everyday, the developer should learn something new and will never stop!
